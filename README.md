    Name: How to Trade EUR/USD Using a Simple Outside Daily Bar Setup
    
    STRATEGY RULES:
    IMPORTANT: You should set your timezone on the charts to EST / New York time, with 5 daily bars per week.
    
    
    LONG / BUY TRADE: - (Also see days of the week below)
    1. Look at the Daily chart at 17:00 EST when the bar is completed.
    2. Looking at Daily charts we want to see an Outside Bar (the high is greater than the high
    of the previous day and the low is less than the low of the previous day).
    3. We also need to see the close of the Outside bar less than the low of the previous day.
    4. If the above conditions are met we enter a Long trade at the open of the next bar.
        Depending on your broker, this will be immediately or up to 15 minutes later (17:15).
        However if the setup bar was on a Friday, the Buy order would be placed on the opening
        bar Sunday.
    5. Place a Stop Loss 200 pips away from your entry price.

    
    
    EXIT RULES:
    Simple exit. Simple often works best!
    You will exit the trade in 1 of 2 ways.
    The most common exit will be in profit.
    
    1. Once in a trade check the close of the next daily bar (17:00 EST). If you are in profit
        then exit at the open of the next bar. Depending on your broker, this will be immediately
        or up to 15 minutes later (17:15). However if the close was on a Friday, then take profit
        at the opening bar on Sunday. But if you are not in profit then leave the trade open.
    2. Or your Stop Loss is hit, you take a loss and you wait for a new trade.
